Was confused on requirement 1. IaC tool automates infrastructure on platforms like AWS. Serverless is a tool to manage 
serverless deployments (like updating the lambda zip). I wrote both build script and serverless.yaml.

Things to Add for Future Deployments
    > Add AWS Secrets to GitHub Actions
    > Add Separate CI/CD Steps for Unit/Integration Tests
    > Add Built Script Step in CI/CD (Pick agent)
